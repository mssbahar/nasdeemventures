2. Uncomment line 41 in `components/MusicToggle.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   audioRef.current.src = '/assets/audio/background-music.mp3'
   ```

1. Visit the website
2. Look for the music toggle button in the navbar (right of Contact Us)
3. Click to toggle the visual state
4. Test keyboard navigation (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to activate)
5. Test on mobile (button appears in mobile menu)
